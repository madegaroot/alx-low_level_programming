here write a description you want and useful for you and everyone look at your directory
the steps to complete these tasks is like the following
as you finished created the empty directory 0x0F-function_pointers be on it using cd and work everything here
to write the codes use cat > file_name then write the code or paste it and when you finish click enter and ctrl + c to stop writting
write the codes including the header file this way
one important thing is to understand the code after all.
good luck sam tech samuel birhanu
